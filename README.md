## Hi there 👋

I'm **Krish**, a B.Tech CSE student specializing in **AI & ML**.

I love building projects in **Python**, exploring **machine learning**, and creating things for the **web**.
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll try to code it and ship it.

My current tech stack includes **Python**, **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, and I’m diving deep into frameworks like **Flask**, **Django**, and **React**.

### **🛠️ Technologies I Use**
⭕ **Languages:** Python, JavaScript
⭕ **Web:** HTML, CSS, Flask, Django
⭕ **ML:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
⭕ **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

If you want, I can format them with **indents**, **icons**, or **GitHub-style markdown sections**.


I’m still learning, improving, and building one project at a time—both public and private.

If you want to follow along with my journey, feel free to check out my repos! 🚀
